3 Models, Plant health, Flow simulation, Energy consumption prediction




## Documentation

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)

PlantSort.py: Plant disease detection code using openCV. Please uncomment "data_to_insert_disease" when server/database has been linked.

Flow simulation: Flow simulation using ansys.

Energy_Model_Predict: Predict energy consumption using flow simulation results in the CSV file.

PlantSolutions: dot NetCore server/database that links with plant disease detection.

Script.SQL: Contains the tables created in the server


## Suggestions and improvements

Disease detection that connects to the server and database only just adds in more rows of tables instead of updated if the same image file name is used.
Maybe future users might want to find a way to update/refresh the contents in the database if a same image file name is being used to scan for disease detection.
